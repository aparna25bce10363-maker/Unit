# Unit Converter

A simple command-line tool to convert between different units. Made this for my first semester Python project.

## What it does

Converts between:
- **Temperature** - Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
- **Length** - kilometers, meters, centimeters, millimeters, miles, feet, inches
- **Weight** - kilograms, grams, milligrams, pounds, ounces

## How to use

1. Run the program:
```bash
python unit_converter.py
```

2. Pick what type of conversion you want (1, 2, or 3)

3. Enter your value and the units you're converting from and to

4. Get your result

## Example

```
===== Unit Converter =====
1. Temperature (C, F, K)
2. Length (km, m, cm, mm, mile, ft, inch)
3. Weight (kg, g, mg, lb, oz)

Choose conversion type (1-3): 1
Enter temperature value: 100
From unit (C/F/K): C
To unit (C/F/K): F

100°C = 212.00°F
```

## What I learned from this project

- How to write functions that take inputs and return values
- Using dictionaries to organize data
- Getting user input and displaying output
- Basic math for conversions
- How the metric and imperial systems work

## Future improvements

Some things I might add later:
- Let users do multiple conversions without restarting
- Add error messages for invalid inputs
- More unit types like volume or speed
- Save conversion history

## Requirements

Just Python 3.x, no external libraries needed.
